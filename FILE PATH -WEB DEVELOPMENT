To make files talk to one another, you have to provide a file path between them — basically a route, so one file knows where another one is. To demonstrate this, we will insert a little bit of HTML into our index.html file, and make it display the image you chose in the article "What will your website look like?" Alternatively, you can choose an existing image at your disposal, on your computer or from the Web, and use it in the following steps:

Copy the image you chose earlier into your images folder.
Open up your index.html file, and insert the following code into the file exactly as shown.
HTML


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="" alt="My test image" />
  </body>
</html>



The line <img src="" alt="My test image"> is the HTML code that inserts an image into the page. We need to tell the HTML where the image is. The image is inside the images directory, which is in the same directory as index.html. To walk down the file structure from index.html to our image, the file path we'd need is images/your-image-filename. For example, our image is called firefox-icon.png, so the file path is images/firefox-icon.png.
Insert the file path into your HTML code between the double quote marks of the src="" code.
Change the contents of the alt attribute to a description of the image you are including. In this case, alt="Firefox logo: flaming fox wrapping the world".
Save your HTML file, then load it in your web browser (double-click the file). You should see your new webpage displaying your image!

Some general rules for file paths:

######To link to a target file in the same directory as the invoking HTML file, just use the filename, e.g. my-image.jpg.
######To reference a file in a subdirectory, write the directory name in front of the path, plus a forward slash, e.g. subdirectory/my-image.jpg.
######To link to a target file in the directory above the invoking HTML file, write two dots. So for example, if index.html was inside a subfolder of test-site and my-image.jpg was inside test-site, you could reference my-image.jpg from index.html using ../my-image.jpg.
######You can combine these as much as you like, for example ../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg.

Note: The Windows file system tends to use backslashes, not forward slashes, e.g. C:\Windows. This doesn't matter in HTML — even if you are developing your website on Windows, you should still use forward slashes in your code.
